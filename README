	FABRIC
----------------------------------------
Fabric is a framework for code generation based on several scientific 
publications [1,2,3]. It is comprised of components for
	- parsing XML Schema and WSDL files into a tree, for
	
	- a module API to walk the tree for codegeneration, and for 
	
	- code generation (C, C++, Java) using simple APIs instead of 
	  writing to stdout.

In addition, a number of modules are contained that generate code
	- microFibre: An XML (de-)compression scheme usable for 
	  ressource-constraint devices [2,3] that generates code for 
	  Java and C++.
	  
	- macroFibre: An XML (de-)serialization scheme for for 
	  ressource-constraint devices [3] that generates code for 
	  Java and C++.
	  
	- XML: XML (de-)serialization for easy conversion from/to 
	  macroFibre/microFibre
	  
	- protobuf: Converts XML Schema files to Google protobuf
	  (http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) files.

Fabric works as follows:
	1.)	Input files are XML Schema and WSDL files which are parsed 
		into a tree. This tree contains most information from the schema 
		but abstracts away from all the nasty details of XML Schema
		and WSDL. It automatically resolves all imports, references, 
		etc. and the resulting tree can directly be used for code 
		generation based on tree-walking.
		
	2.)	A so-called workspace is created that can be used for code 
		generation. A workspace represents a set of files of a certain 
		language (e.g., Java files) in memory. Users of the workspace use 
		language-specific APIs to add components to the files (e.g., a 
		Java class). To such elements, further stuff can be added (e.g., 
		methods). The benefit over directly writing code to stdout is
		that code can be added at any time in any order. Once the 
		generation is done, the workspace can be serialized to the disk.
		
	3.)	A set of modules is invoked to handle the parsed tree. Modules are 
		basically tree-walkers that react to events that are the result 
		from walking the tree (e.g., handling a root element of a schema).
		
	4.)	The workspace is written to the disk.

INSTALLATION / BUILDING
----------------------------------------
No installation is required. To build fabric, you need Java 6 and 
Maven (http://maven.apache.org/). 

To build, run "mvn install", this will build fabric and place the 
generated jar file in target/ and in your local Maven repository.
